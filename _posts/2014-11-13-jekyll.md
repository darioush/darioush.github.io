This is mostly here to prevent emptiness, but also to promote [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
It's a relatively no-hassle system that gives you a simple static website, but also
supports adding blog-like posts for the occasional writing you may have.

Reasons why you may choose [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) as a busy academic:

* Hosting support from `github` pages,
* Easy support for code highlighting,
* Write in `markdown`,
* Built with `git` in mind, so adding a post is as easy as adding a file and pushing -- no databases to set up.
* Out of the box support for [`sass`](http://sass-lang.com), a variable language for CSS.
* Basic templating support, so your inner programmer doesn't die at the thought of copying code around.
* Just static files, good old HTML and CSS, no framework mumbo-jumbo to learn!
