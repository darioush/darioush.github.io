I'm attending [FSE 2014][fse] in the upcoming week. Allow me to shamelessly promote [my work](/publications/) on
evaluating mutation testing, which we will present around 2:45pm in the [Auditorium][fse-link].

If you're there and interested in talking about testing, software, or anything else, let me know.
I'll be there Nov. 16 -- Nov. 21.
