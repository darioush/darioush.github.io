    {% capture about %}
I'm a second year PhD student, and I do software engineering research with
my adviser [Michael Ernst][mernst] at the [PLSE][plse] group at University of Washington.
I have previously worked with [Raman Ramsin][ramsin] at Sharif.

I research software testing, in particular I try to quantify the value of tests.
I also try to use automated program analysis to help developers
gain confidence in their code.


Recently, I've been looking at proof-assistant aided verification, and some dark part of me
wants to find a reasonable compromise between testing and proofs.
